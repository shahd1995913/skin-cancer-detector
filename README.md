# skin-cancer-detector
**An application that uses artificial intelligence in diagnosing skin cancer by analyzing the images that are entered. Four types of skin cancers were selected and trained on a deep learning model that can recognize various skin diseases with more than 90% accuracy.**


# Steps :

## 1. Important Packeges in Python.

## 2. Reading is a database that contains a set of images. 

### Sample of data in dataset  , There is 4 Categories of Skin Cancer.
### A. High Risk: Melanoma

## 3. The database has been divided into a training set and a test set.

## 4. normalization on the images and resize to 224.

## 5.  Using a deep learning system called   CNN Model on an image database.


 ## 6. Evaluation of the model and obtaining accuracy, and the accuracy was 90.

 ## 7. save the Model.  "model.tflite"

 ## 8. Integrate  "model.tflite"the form with the Android application.

 ## 9. Building the application and the front end in Android.
 
## 10. Implementation and testing of the application and the results were accurate.
